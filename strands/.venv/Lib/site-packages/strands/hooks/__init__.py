"""Typed hook system for extending agent functionality.

This module provides a composable mechanism for building objects that can hook
into specific events during the agent lifecycle. The hook system enables both
built-in SDK components and user code to react to or modify agent behavior
through strongly-typed event callbacks.

Example Usage:
    ```python
    from strands.hooks import HookProvider, HookRegistry
    from strands.hooks.events import BeforeInvocationEvent, AfterInvocationEvent

    class LoggingHooks(HookProvider):
        def register_hooks(self, registry: HookRegistry) -> None:
            registry.add_callback(BeforeInvocationEvent, self.log_start)
            registry.add_callback(AfterInvocationEvent, self.log_end)

        def log_start(self, event: BeforeInvocationEvent) -> None:
            print(f"Request started for {event.agent.name}")

        def log_end(self, event: AfterInvocationEvent) -> None:
            print(f"Request completed for {event.agent.name}")

    # Use with agent
    agent = Agent(hooks=[LoggingHooks()])
    ```

This replaces the older callback_handler approach with a more composable,
type-safe system that supports multiple subscribers per event type.
